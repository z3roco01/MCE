// 4J added - Storage for data (ie the extra per tile storage). Data is normally stored as 4-bits per tile, in a DataLayer class of 16384 bytes ( 128 x 16 x 16 x 0.5 )
// This class provides more economical storage for such data by taking into consideration that it is quite common for large parts of the data to be very compressible (ie zero).
// We are aiming here to balance performance (this data is accessed very frequently) against size.

// Details of storage method:

// 1. Data is split into horizontal planes, of which there are 128, and each taking up 128 bytes (16 x 16 x 0.5)
// 2. Each of these layers has a permanently allocated index in this class (planeIndices).
// 3. Data for allocatedPlaneCount planes worth of data is allocated in the data array ( allocatedPlaneCount * 128 bytes )
// 4. If a plane index for a layer is < 128, then the data for that layer is at data[ index * 128 ]
// 5. If a plane index for a layer is 128, then all values for that plane are 0

// This class needs to be thread safe as there are times where chunk data is shared between server & main threads. Data values are queried
// very regularly so this needs to be as light-weight as possible.

// To meet these requirements, this class is now implemented using a lock-free system, implemented using a read-copy-update (RCU) type algorithm. Some details...

// (1) The storage details for the class are now packed into a single __int64, which contains both a pointer to the data that is required and a count of how many planes worth
//     of storage are allocated. This allows the full storage to be updated atomically using compare and exchange operations (implemented with InterlockedCompareExchangeRelease64).
// (2) The data pointer referenced in this __int64 points to an area of memory which is 128 + 128 * plane_count bytes long, where the first 128 bytes stoere the plane indices, and
//     the rest of the data is variable in size to accomodate however many planes are required to be stored
// (3) The RCU bit of the algorithm means that any read operations don't need to do any checks or locks at all. When the data needs to be updated, a copy of it is made and updated,
//     then an attempt is made to swap the new data in - if this succeeds then the old data pointer is deleted later at some point where we know nothing will be reading from it anymore.
//     This is achieved by putting the delete request in a queue which means it won't actually get deleted until 2 game ticks after the last time its reference existed, which should give
//     us a large margin of safety. If the attempt to swap the new data in fails, then the whole write operation has to be attempted again - this is the only time there is really a
//     high cost for this algorithm and such write collisions should be rare.
